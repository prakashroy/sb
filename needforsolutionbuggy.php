                     a substantial share in the GDP of India. With the ‘Make in India’ initiative, the manufacturing sector have been
                      given the required thrust and an optimal environment for growth. The MSME manufacturing sector is considered as 
                      an important pillar of the Indian economy as it has the potential to shift and elevate the Indian workforce out of the low wage agriculture occupation. <br><br>
					Nearly 40% of the total output by manufacturing sector in India is shared by MSME sector with more than 115 lakh enterprises all over 
                    India with share of 7.04% GDP<br><br>
					Though the sector with its distinct characteristics has infinite opportunities for growth but at the 
                    same time, there are many challenges that are faced by SMEs :<br><br>
